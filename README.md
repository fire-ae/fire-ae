- 👋 Hi, I’m @fire-ae, or more properly, FIRE Araştırma Eğitim Limited Şirketi.
- 🫡 I’m here for conducting independent scientific research, enhancing other researchers' works, creating reference materials and provide trainings to researchers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning astrophysics, improving my chemistry and applied statistics, also learning Python and improving water quality modeling skills!
- 💞️ I’m looking for collaborations on point source detections in stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research, and source apportionment of water pollutants. I can both lead and support scientific research projects.
- 📫 You can reach me via fireae24@gmail.com or via here!
- 😎 Pronouns: Researcher
- ⚡ Fun fact: FIRE stands for more than three relevant meaningful words in multiple languages! One is Fundamental and Interdisciplinary REsearch!
